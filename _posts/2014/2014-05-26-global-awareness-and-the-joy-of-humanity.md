This Memorial Day (in the United States) we took quite a non-traditional stance. In order to remember all of our fallen heroes I took to heart a piece of advice I saw on Twitter today:

> My annual Memorial Day message: The best way to honor our war veterans is to stop producing so damned many of them. http://twitter.com/radleybalko/status/470932505907167232

Soldiers the world over have sacrificed more than our simple BBQ holiday will ever be able to celebrate. So today, in an effort to continue facilitating a love and respect for all living things in our children, I purchased the movie [Samsara][1] for us to watch.


![Samsara][2]

> SAMSARA is a Sanskrit word that means “the ever turning wheel of life” and is the point of departure for the filmmakers as they search for the elusive current of interconnection that runs through our lives. Filmed over a period of almost five years and in twenty-five countries, SAMSARA transports us to sacred grounds, disaster zones, industrial sites, and natural wonders. By dispensing with dialogue and descriptive text, SAMSARA subverts our expectations of a traditional documentary, instead encouraging our own inner interpretations inspired by images and music that infuses the ancient with the modern. http://www.barakasamsara.com/samsara/about

The audio in this documentary contains no dialog and is strictly atmospheric and musical. It instead relies solely on the power of moving images and music to convey a much deeper meaning. The juxtapositions can be stark while the beauty is breathtaking. In the end I find all that is left is the core essence of what makes us all lifetime members of the human race.

In watching this film with 6, 8, and 10 year old children many discussions arise. The pure innocence and awe that they bring further enhanced the film. At times I felt ashamed and convicted. Other times I was stunned by the magnificence that we we saw. Even the children, at times, were speechless. There is something about this film that rings so true and so deeply that it quickly rises to my “must see” category.

Grab a glass of wine, sit back, and allow yourself to spend the time venturing beyond the confines of your comfortable first-world living room. The world at our feet is truly filled with endless wonders.
