I know I can do all this via the command line, but I use a Mac because I have the power of a command line with an elegant UI. So, in light of that, I use and enjoy [Tower][1]. Here is a new automation workflow for [Alfred][2] that helps make Tower more powerful.

I recently [asked Tower][3] if it would be possible to push to all remotes a the same time, or if there was additional entries being added to the AppleScript dictionary I could use for this. Unfortunately it’s not possible but thankfully AppleScript still allows you to control UI elements as well!

This isn’t as elegant as a natively built-in feature but will definitely do the trick until such day as this feature can be included. Thank you AppleScript and [Alfred][2]!

The video only demonstrates pushing to remotes, but I included a workflow to pull from all remotes as well.
