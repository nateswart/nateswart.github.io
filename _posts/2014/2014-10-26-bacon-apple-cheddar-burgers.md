Because recipes are yet another form of data and good food makes the fleshy part of our being very happy, here's a rough recipe I made up that I loosely follow when we need something easy-yet-special on the grill.

## Ingredients

*   1 medium apple, chopped to 1/4-inch cubes
*   1 lb ground beef
*   1 small onion - chopped
*   1 egg
*   5 slices bacon, chopped
*   3/4 cup shredded cheddar, the sharper the better
*   parsley

## Directions

The directions are wicked-easy: thoroughly mix all the indredients, and make into burger patties. I find that making the burgers concave (as opposed to perfectly level) helps make them come out normal on the grill instead of turning into convex UFOs.

Grill and enjoy!

Most of the time I'll eat them as-is with no extra condiments. If you must have something extra, I find that a nice honey mustard compliments the apples well.
