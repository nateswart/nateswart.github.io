I thought I'd try my luck at making some costume jewelry (at least for my daughters, if not my wife as well). I still may use a metal printing service like [Shapeways][1] for nicer jewelry for my wife, but the homemade 3D printed jewelry has the kid-advantage of being cheap, very light, and a fun project for them.

For these earrings, I grabbed the model from [Thingiverse][2], printed them with black ABS filament, and then used silver nail polish to finish them off.
