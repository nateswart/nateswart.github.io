title: Creating Weekday-only iOS Reminders
---

Here's a quick tip; have you ever wanted to create a daily, but weekday-only, repeating task in iOS Reminders? The UI is rather limited but the functionality does exist.

Siri to the rescue!

Simply tell Siri something like:

> Remember to pack a lunch on weekdays

Siri will offer to create the remknder for you and it will have a custom repeat setting. once created you wont be able to view/edit the repeat settings in Reminders, but thats not a huge deal since it's sinple enough to ask Siri to create you a new one!
